===========================

Connecting ninjablocks to a thermostat with node

This project uses node ninjablocks to get the temperature of the ninjablocks temperature sensor and then executes a child process to pynest to change the temperature of the nest thermostat.  It can also trigger the air conditioner but it's currently disabled because it's cold outside.
